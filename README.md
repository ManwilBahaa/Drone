## Project Description

In this project, I have designed and developed a fully-functional drone utilizing the power of the Atmega32 microcontroller. The journey involved writing essential drivers and implementing key embedded systems concepts, such as ADC, Interrupts, timers, UART communication protocol, and PWM. The result is a seamless and efficient drone system that can be controlled remotely. 🌐🤖

Additionally, I have integrated various external peripherals, including an LCD display, temperature and pressure sensors, and digital input/output modules (DIOs). These components enhance the drone's capabilities and provide valuable data to users, increasing the overall user experience. 📟🌡️✨
